rem enabled, then /exit). Windows only lets file links be made from an administrator prompt or
rem with Developer Mode on, so right-click this file and choose "Run as administrator".
rem It finds the game folder from its own location, so run the copy that is installed in
rem   <World of Warcraft>\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns\RudeBoy\

rem Once Blizzard fixes the loader the real settings load after Saved.lua and take over.
